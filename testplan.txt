Testplan for the Search API
---------------------------

1) Functional Testing:
   - Test for different sizes of the input array (arrays having only 1
     element to arrays having multiple elements)
   - Test for parameter validation
     - NULL input arrays not allowed
     - n_items is always greater than 0
     - index pointer is not NULL
   - Test for all SearchType combinations for both ascending and
     descending sorted order arrays:
     - LessThan
     - LessThanEquals
     - Equals
     - GreaterThanEquals
     - GreaterThan

   NOTE:
   -----
   A total of 53 automated functional unit tests have been implemented.
   All functional tests have been automated using CxxTest unit testing
   framework.
   Source file containing the implementation of the Search API is at:
              src/search.cpp(.h)
   All unit tests are located at:
              test/searchtest.ut
   A Makefile has been provided at
              Makefile

   This Makefile will do the following:
   - Package the Search API implementation at
              src/search.cpp
     as a userspace library
              lib/libsearcher.a
   - Compile the unit tests (under
              test/searchtest.ut
     and build a test binary
              test/testrunner
   - Run the unit tests and generate a code coverage report for the
     source file. The HTML file containing the code coverage is
     located at
              coverage/index.html
     and
              coverage/src/search.cpp.gcov.html
     Opening the above HTML files in a browser: 
              file://localhost/<yourdir>/coverage/src/search.cpp.gcov.html
     will help you see the code coverage report

   Line and Branch Coverage of the unit tests have been verified using
   Gcov. Here is the coverage rate for the functional unit tests.

   Overall coverage rate:
     lines......: 100.0% (30 of 30 lines)
     functions..: 100.0% (1 of 1 function)
     branches...: 96.7% (29 of 30 branches)
